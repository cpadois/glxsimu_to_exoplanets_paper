# Modelling the Milky Way's exoplanet population based on cosmological galaxy simulations

This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the figures of Padois et al. (2026).

# Data availability

All data necessary to reproduce the figures are available in [this drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XCubmlklQK1YoEVygK9Mz06laf4u79iE?usp=sharing).
The galactic simulations files are from the NIHAO-UHD suite of simulation ([Buck et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.3461B/abstract)), extracting only the stellar particles components.

# Installation

To run the plots notebook, first clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/cpadois/glxsimu_to_exoplanets_paper.git`
Then download the necessary files from the [drive]((https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XCubmlklQK1YoEVygK9Mz06laf4u79iE?usp=sharing)).
Ready to run the notebook (`figures_clean_Padois25.ipynb`)!
